# Applying functions in R

Installing to read Excel files:

```{r}
# install.packages('rio') # installs necessary package for reading Excel files
```

# reading data

```{r}
# opening a file from a url (file in Excel), name it 'fragility23'
linkGit="https://github.com/FuntamendalsSteven/demo2/raw/refs/heads/main/FSI-2023-DOWNLOAD.xlsx" # assigns url link to string variable named, 'linkGit'

# library(rio) # package needed
fragility23=rio::import(file = linkGit) #object that will hold the result # fragility23 is an object that will hold data, most likely a data frame
```

```{r}
str(fragility23) # returns the internal structure of the object fragility23
```

## Apply square root function?

```{r}
# whole DF?
# sqrt(fragility23) # Cannot apply square root function to entire data frame because there are non number columns (Country and Rank) so returns an Error
```

```{r}
# several columns (only numerical)

sqrt(fragility23[,4:5]) # Computes the square roots of the all rows (all values) of the 4th and 5th columns (Total and S1: Demographic Pressures)
```

```{r}
# one column
sqrt(fragility23$Total) # computes the square root of the values of the Total column
```

```{r}
# one value
sqrt(fragility23$Total[1]) # computes the square root of a single value, the value of the first row of the Total column in fragility23, i.e. [row][column] = a single value
```

## Applying **sum()**:

```{r}
# sum everything
sum(fragility23[,4:5]) # Sums together all rows (values) of the 4th and 5th columns of fragility23
```

```{r}
# sum by column
print(apply(fragility23[,4:5],2,sum)) # displays to screen the modified version of a copy of fragility23 where the 4th and 5th columns are summed by the apply function (each column summed with all its row values). 2 input represents the column
```

```{r}
#notice
typeof(apply(fragility23[,4:5],2,sum)) # shows the type value of the modified version of a copy of fragility23 where the 4th and 5th columns are summed column wise (each column summed with all its row values) by the apply function
```

If you do not see **list**, then it is a vector. ⏫

```{r}
# sum by row
print(apply(fragility23[,4:5],1,sum)) # displays to screen the modified version of a copy of fragility23 where the 4th and 5th columns are summed row wise (each row summed with all its column values) by the apply function. 1 input represents the rows
```

### Apply by iterating:

```{r}
print(lapply(fragility23[,4:5],sum)) # displays to the screen a list returned by the lapply function that performs a summation on the 4th and 5th columns of fragility23.
```

Notice output of **lapply**:

```{r}
typeof(lapply(fragility23[,4:5],sum)) # returns the variable type of the return of the above function. It is indeed a list
```

```{r}
class(lapply(fragility23[,4:5],sum)) # returns the high-level abstraction category of how R treats the return of the above function
```

Notice output of **sapply**:

```{r}
print(sapply(fragility23[,4:5],sum)) # displays to screen a vector or matrix produced by the applied summation function on the 4th and 5th column of fragility23
```

```{r}
class(sapply(fragility23[,4:5],sum)) # returns the high level abstraction of how R treats the return from the above function. R identifies it as a numeric.
```

Similarly:

```{r}
print(lapply(fragility23[,4:5],sqrt)) # displays to screen a list produced by the applied sqrt function on each row value of the 4th and 5th column of fragility23
```

```{r}
class(lapply(fragility23[,4:5],sqrt)) # returns the high level abstraction category of how R treats the return from the above function. The above function returns a list.
```

```{r}
print(sapply(fragility23[,4:5],sqrt)) # displays to the screen a vector or matrix produced by the applied sqrt function on the 4th and 5th column of fragility23
```

```{r}
class(sapply(fragility23[,4:5],sqrt)) # returns the variable category (matrix or array) created by the function sapply (a vector or matrix produced by the applied sqrt function on the 4th and 5th column of fragility23) that determines R behavior
```

Now our own function:

```{r}
theOnesOK = function(DF_country_and_variable) {
  variable_values <- DF_country_and_variable[,2]
  avg_value <- mean(variable_values, na.rm = TRUE)
  is_above <- ifelse(variable_values > avg_value, "Above Average", "Below/At Average")
  DF_country_and_variable$Status <- is_above
  return(DF_country_and_variable)
}
```

```{r}
theOnesOK(fragility23[,c('Country','S1: Demographic Pressures')])
```

```{r}
mystery=function(DF,positionsToUse,CountryColumn='Country'){
  newDF=DF[,c(CountryColumn),drop = FALSE]
  average='average'
  newDF[,average]=apply(DF[,positionsToUse],1,mean,na.rm = TRUE)
  return(newDF[,c(CountryColumn,average)])
}
```

```{r}
mystery(fragility23,4:6)
```
